This episode looks at the problem, as perceived by the authors,
that the rendering of a fully offline capable lesson would solve.

One of the plus points about the Software Carpentry's lesson content,
as produced with the current rendering approach, is that everything
needed to use the lesson is contained within `_site` directory.

One could imagine that lessons might even be distributed, within
teaching arenas where connectivity is not guaranteed, simply by
passing around some media that merely contained the `_site` directory.

## Browsing lesson content with `file:///` URIs

### The Lesson's home page

The first impression, of the rendering of a lesson's content following a
`make site`, when viewed via a `file:///` URI, probably doesn't give much
cause for concern, however attempting to access pages via links within the 
menus and footer bars, and to the individual episodes themselves linked
to from with the Schedule, doesn't provide as seamless an experience as
one might wish for. 

<img style="border:2px solid black" src="{{ page.root }}/fig/foc-browse_home_file_uri.png" alt="Home Page as file URI" />

Let's see what happens when we click on the link to Episode 1, Introduction.

### The target of the Episode 1 links, as currently rendered 

Oh dear!

Rather than presenting us with Episode's page, the link underneath
the Schedule's content merely takes us to a directory index of the 
directory that the file containing the Episode's actual content is
stored within,

<img style="border:2px solid black" src="{{ page.root }}/fig/foc-click_lesson1_link.png" alt="Lesson1 link destination" />

and indeed, an inspection of the URI in the address field does show
a bare directory path, so, in all fairness to the browser, it has
actually presented to us what we *requested*, even if what we actually
*wanted* was the Episode's actual content, as contained in the `index.html`
file that we can see.

Let's  see what happens when we click on the link to `index.html`

### The target of the Episode 1 directory's index.html link, as currently rendered 

Admittedly, it has taken us two clicks to get here, but we do now
have the Episode's actual content presented to us, however, there
are clearly a couple of places where things don't look quite right.

<img style="border:2px solid black" src="{{ page.root }}/fig/foc-browse_lesson1_index_file.png" alt="Lesson1 Page as file URI" />

Typically, we'd expect to see navigation arrows in the four corners of 
page, and thematic highlighter images in the `Overview` and `Key Points`
areas' title bars but the images are missing.

Furthermore, clicking on links within the Episode will only ever take
us back to a directory index of the directory containing the file,
`index.html`, that we actually *wanted* to be presented to us.

### So what's going on? Isn't this the same content that GitHub's gh-pages branch uses?
 
Indeed, it is the same content as presented by the GitHub webserver
from a Lesson's `gh-pages` branch and furthermore, the `_site` directory
is also exactly the same directory hierachy of content that Jekyll's own
minimal webserver would present to us, if started locally, and both of
those provide a seamless navigation around the Lesson.

In order to understand why our file-based browsing of a Software
Carpentry Lesson's content is currently a sub-optimal experience,
we need to take a look at how webservers respond to various requests
to present data back to the browser. 

## Webserver 101

Clearly, as we have seen above, the Software Carpentry's current rendering
of Lesson content results in link targets that merely contain path components
as far as the directory containing the file containing the actual content.

### What we see from the browser

Perhaps the ideal example to use to highlight what happens with Software
Carpentry Lesson content as presented by a webserver would be to use a
browser to view the rendered contents of Greg Wilson's `lesson-example`
repository, as presented by the webserver at `github.io`

[https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/](https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/)

and then navigate to an Episode within that Lesson, say Episode 2,

[https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/02-tooling/](https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/02-tooling/)

What we may find surprising, given that we know that Software Carpentry
Lesson content is actually stored in files named `index.html`, is that the
URIs we see in our browser's address bar are merely paths to directories,
not to the files themselves, and yet we are not getting the directory
index that our file-based browsing of the same content produced.

The answer lies in  the fact that directories can contain more than
one file, and may even contain other subdirectories, and so whilst
we only saw one file `index.html` in the directory listing of our
Lessons's `_site/01-introduction` directory, had we clicked back 
through to the Lesson's home page, we would have been presented
with the directory index of the `_site` directory itself.

If we do that from within the shell, we see a number of files and
sub-directories, alongside what we know to be the file that contains
the actual home page content.

```
$ ls _site/
01-introduction/  about/    discuss/         fig/        license/
AUTHORS           aio/      favicon-dc.ico   figures/    reference/
CITATION          assets/   favicon-lc.ico   guide/      setup/
CONTRIBUTING.md   conduct/  favicon-swc.ico  index.html
```

Clearly then, our file-based browsing of a directory has no way to
make a choice of what to display, and so displays an index of all
the files and sub-directories, whereas a webserver, or rather the
webserver at `github.io`, appears to be deciding that it will present
the file named `index.html` to us.

(Aside to develop: back in the days of 8.3 filenames, `index.htm`
might have been the file presented.)

### What the webserver does when our browser makes requests of it

As you might imagine, the name of the file, containing the content
that a webserver will present back when it receives a request for 
a directory is usually configurable and indeed, in the documentation
for this particular configuration of the Apache (**defn?**) webserver,

[https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_dir.html#directoryindex)

we get a very concise explanation of what's going on, and we see that 
the concept is even referred to as the `DirectoryIndex Directive`.

```
DirectoryIndex Directive

Description:	List of resources to look for when the client requests a directory
Syntax:		DirectoryIndex disabled | local-url [local-url] ...
Default:	DirectoryIndex index.html
Context:	server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
Override:	Indexes
Status:		Base
Module:		mod_dir


The DirectoryIndex directive sets the list of resources to look for,
when the client requests an index of the directory by specifying a / at
the end of the directory name.

Local-url is the (%-encoded) URL of a document on the server relative to
the requested directory; it is usually the name of a file in the directory.

Several URLs may be given, in which case the server will return the first
one that it finds. If none of the resources exist and the Indexes option is
set, the server will generate its own listing of the directory.
```

So now we know what's happening when we access the content via a webserver:
the webserver is automatically presenting the content from a default
filename `index.html`, as though it had been appended onto our URI.

In other words, what we are actually being presented with, when we view
Greg's rendered content at `github.io`, are the files

[https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/index.html](https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/index.html)

and

[https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/02-tooling/index.html](https://gvwilson.github.io/lesson-example/02-tooling/index.html)

and not the directory indexes, despite the fact that our requests to the
webserver don't explcityly contain the file names.

## So the answer to `file:///` navigation problems is: just append `index.html` ?

When it's written like that, youl'd have to say that it does seem simple
doesn't it, however as you may already have discovered, on occasions 
where you have suggested to someone that it's **just** a matter of doing
something, the size of a "just" can vary widely, depending on the
beholder!

Indeed, one argument, for not **just** appending `index.html` throughout
the existing canon of Software Carpentry Lesson material, is that there
are a lot of links within that existing body of work and few if anyone
will want go through it all, **just** adding `index.html` in the required
places.

As we'll see in the next episode though, Software Carpentry's rendering
methodology, built as it is upon templates and lesson-wide variables,
so as to make Lesson content creation as simple as possible, is not
only the perfect vehicle for automating the addition of the `index.html`
strings into the Lesson content, but also means that we can do so in
a way that preserves the existing behaviour where we wish, thereby
reducing the size of the "just".
