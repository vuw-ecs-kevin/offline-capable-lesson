# offline-capable-lesson

The material provided here seeks to take a Software Carpentry (SWC)
Lesson approach to describing the process by which the standard SWC
lesson style may be altered so as to allow for a Lesson’s rendered
HTML to not only be viewed using a webserver, but also when just
using basic `file:///` URIs, which we term an “offline rendering”.

As this lesson is unlikely to be given within an official SWC event,
it also seeks to provide a template that allows for non-SWC branding
(or perhaps SWC de-branding ?) to be applied, whilst maintaining the
look and feel that people familiar with studying content from official
SWC lessons will have become used to, as well as making it easier for
content from within non-SWC lessons to be re-used withn official SWC
material.

Please see <https://vuw-ecs-kevin.github.io/offline-capable-lesson/>
for a rendered version of this material, which is, effectively, a
proof of concept, or rather, a proof of that part of the concept.
