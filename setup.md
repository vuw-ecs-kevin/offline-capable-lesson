Whilst one could follow the instructions for creating a standalone
lesson, as found upon the SWC's [lesson-example]({{ site.example_repo}})
rendered setup page, 

[{{ site.swc_pages }}/lesson-example/setup/index.html]({{ site.swc_pages }}/lesson-example/setup/index.html)

the modifications that get applied to a lesson's souce material
can just as easily be applied into a branch, within a local Git 
repo of any lesson, that the reader can set aside for exploring
the approaches that this lesson seeks to promote.

Note that the URI given above for the page within the SWC's GitHub
pages website has an explicit `index.html` appeneded to the bare
path URI , which would be

[{{ site.swc_pages }}/lesson-example/setup/]({{ site.swc_pages }}/lesson-example/setup/)

so as to alert any readers, unfamiliar with the concept of webservers
automatically appending filenames to bare URIs, to the fact that
even when a  bare URI is suppllied, the webserver will usually serve 
the contents of a file, and that that file will typically be named
`index.html`.
